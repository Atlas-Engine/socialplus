# SocialPlus – Changelog

## 1.0.1 – 2025-12-01
- Copy Character Name: when a non–Battle.net friend has no realm shown (e.g. “Unknown”), SocialPlus now appends **your current realm** so you can invite them with a proper `Name-Realm` string.
- This only affects normal WoW friends from **your region**; the cross-region safety logic for Battle.net friends remains unchanged.
- Minor internal clean-ups around the friend menu and character-name resolution.
