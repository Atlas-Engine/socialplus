SocialPlus

A Modern Social Upgrade for World of Warcraft: MoP Classic

SocialPlus enhances the MoP Classic friends list with modern UI behavior, a smarter invite engine, customizable friend groups, and quality-of-life improvements that make the social panel more intuitive and powerful.
Lightweight, responsive, and designed to feel native to the game.

⭐ Features
🎯 Smart Invite System (BNet + Non-BNet)

SocialPlus replaces Blizzard’s outdated MoP-era invite logic with a custom engine:

Works for Battle.net friends

Works for normal WoW friends (non-BNet)

Supports cross-realm invites in MoP Classic

Shows clear red tooltips when inviting is not possible

Blizzard’s client restrictions are inconsistent in MoP Classic — SocialPlus fixes that.

👥 Friend Groups

Organize your friends list your way:

Create custom groups

Assign or remove friends

Collapsible category headers

Clean visual separation

Persistent saved settings

Perfect for large or community-driven friend lists.

🎨 UI Enhancements

Shows your own faction icon for players in MoP Classic (opposing faction icons will be supported in a future update).

Invite buttons restored for non-BNet WoW friends

No layout conflicts with UI frameworks

Everything integrates seamlessly into Blizzard’s Social UI.

⚙️ Customization Options

Right-click any group header to access:

Hide all max-level characters

Enable or disable class-colored names

Hide all offline players

Collapse or expand groups

Remove or rename groups

🔧 MoP-Classic Engine Improvements

MoP Classic uses a hybrid social API that causes inconsistent behavior in the default UI.
SocialPlus improves these areas:

Restores cross-realm invites

Fixes incorrect realm/client restriction messages

Ensures offline characters never retain faction icons
