# SocialPlus

A modern upgrade for the MoP Classic friends list — rebuilt to feel like Blizzard shipped it in 2025.
Streamlined, polished, and dramatically more useful than the default Social panel.

 

## ⭐ Core Features
SocialPlus introduces a smarter, cleaner, fully enhanced Social UI:

- **Real search bar** with accent-insensitive matching. 
- **Universal invites** for BNet + WoW friends. 
- **Custom friend groups** with clean organization tools. 
- **Correct icons, clean layout, no overlaps or missing buttons.
- **Safe, MoP-compatible code** with zero taint issues.

Everything feels native — just better.

 

## 🔍 Instant Search
Find friends immediately by typing a few characters.

- Normalizes accents and symbols. 
- Updates results in real-time without performance cost.

 

## 🎯 Modern Invite Logic
Old MoP restrictions are replaced with clear and reliable behavior:

- Direct invites for all BNet and in-game friends.
- Full cross-realm support. 
- Accurate version checks. 
- Meaningful messages when an invite isn’t possible.

The invite button finally behaves predictably.

 

## 👥 Custom Groups
Organize your list however you want:

- Create, rename, and delete groups. 
- Drag-free assignment via note-based tagging. 
- Collapsible sections with online/offline counters. 
- Automatically saved in friend notes using `#GroupName`.

 

## ⚙️ Lightweight Options
Right-click any group to configure:

- Hide offline entries. 
- Hide max-level characters. 
- Toggle class colors.
- Manage or remove the group.

Everything is minimal, fast, and unobtrusive.

 

## ✨ Quality of Life
- Enhanced responsiveness when scrolling through large friend lists.


## 🔧 MoP Fixes
SocialPlus resolves several MoP-specific issues:

- Incorrect restriction messages.
- Cross-realm invite inconsistencies.
- Realm name handling quirks.

Your friend list finally behaves like the modern game.
