# SocialPlus

A modern, MoP-Classic-ready enhancement to the Friends List — rebuilt to feel like Blizzard shipped it today.  
Fast, organized, and clean, with zero taint issues and a fully native look.

## ⭐ What SocialPlus Improves
The default MoP Social panel was functional, but dated.  
SocialPlus upgrades it with a smarter layout, better logic, and tools the game should have had from the start.

- A **real search bar** that ignores accents and symbols.
- **Reliable invites** for both BNet and in-game friends.
- **Custom friend groups** that stay neatly organized.
- Correct icons, spacing, and panel alignment.
- Fully MoP-compatible code with no UI taint.

Everything feels native — just way better.

## 🔍 Instant Search
Find anyone instantly.

- Accent-insensitive text matching.
- Updates in real time as you type.
- Designed to be fast even with huge friend lists.

---

## 🎯 Smart Invite Handling
The invite button finally behaves like it should.

- Cross-realm support works consistently.
- Clear messages when invites aren’t possible.
- Correct version checks for MoP Classic.
- Unified logic for BNet and character-based friends.

You’ll never guess whether an invite will fail again.

## 👥 Custom Friend Groups
Organize your list effortlessly.

- Create, rename, and delete groups on the fly.
- Assign friends to groups using simple note tags (`#GroupName`).
- Collapsible sections with online/offline counters.
- Notes stay synced — no external data saved.

Zero clutter. Maximum control.
